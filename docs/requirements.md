- Add comments to attendance records
- View attendance records by group and date range
- Update existing attendance records

### Reporting and Statistics
- View attendance statistics for individual students
- Generate attendance reports for groups
- Filter attendance data by month

## Technical Requirements

### User Interface
- Dashboard for group overview
- Forms for attendance recording
- Monthly calendar view for attendance records
- Statistical views for attendance analysis

## Constraints
